Hello, 
   My name is Shannon Lynn Woolfolk. I grew up in Murfreesboro, TN. In the fall of 2008, I went to Maryville College, where I majored in Environmental Studies and minored in German. Since graduating, I have worked five seasons with the National Park Service. Three summers have been spent in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and two winters in Everglades National Park. My latest season in the Smokies lasted until November, which is why I am starting grad school in January. Like you might have guessed, I love being outside and exploring nature. Whenever I'm not studying, I'll be whitewater kayaking, hiking, or biking. I hope to use my Masters of Geography to continue working for the National Park Service or other government agency in the environmental field.
