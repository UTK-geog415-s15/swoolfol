Yes, I know that was in the tutorial.  I want to see it here.\n\n - Describe the visual appearance of the two plots.  Do they \"feel\" like they describe the same data?  \n - Describe how you might be able to mislead readers by changing the scaling on graphs.  \n - Which plot seems more appropriate here?  Why?\n\n# Question 2\nThis question is designed to give you some practice with ggplot as well as describing plots in words.\n\nUse ggplot to create a scatterplot that has Female christenings on the x-axis and Male christenings on the y-axis.  Draw a 45 degree line (using geom_abline) to show the line where Male and Female christenings are equal.  Use this figure to describe the relationship and distribution of Male and Female christenings.\n\n\n\n# Question 3\n\nThis is a question about population, sample, representativeness and generalizability.\n\nHow do you think the christenings-based sample would compared to a births-based sample?  Similar?  Different?  Why?  Arbuthnot's data probably included most every christening in London during this period; they probably aren't any unreported christenings.  Is this fact important?  Why or why not?  Would a christenings based sample be appropriate now, in the 21st century?  (Hint, this last question is trickier than it might seem.  Think about what causes Male/Female Births, what causes people to christen their children, and any relations or not between these)\n\n# Question 4\nWhat does \"sex ratio at birth\" mean?  How does it depend on biology, cuture and technology.  Consider the three cases of 1) late 17th century England, 2) 21st century US, and China under the [one-child policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).\n\n\n# Question 5\nThe purpose of this quetion is to give you a little practice using standard deviation.\n\na. The average height of young women ages 18-24 is 64.5 in.  The distribution of heights is approximately normal (Gaussian) with a standardard deviation of $\\sigma=2.5$.  Complete this sentence: Approximately 95% of women have a height greater than ______ in and less than ______ in.\n\n# Question 6\nThe purpose of this question is to help you understand the variance.\n\nThe formula for sample variance $\\sigma^2$ of a dataset is:\n$$\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{N-1}$$\nDescribe in words what each part of this equation is, and using the concept of \"distance\" describe what the sample variance measures.\n\n",
